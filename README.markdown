## 🚀 How It Works – Simple & Powerful

2. **Instant Execution**: Parses signals and executes market/limit orders in MT5 based on your settings.
3. **Risk Control**: Adjusts lot sizes dynamically to match your risk tolerance.
4. **Trade Optimization**: Manages trades by setting SL to breakeven on TP1 and canceling unexecuted orders.
